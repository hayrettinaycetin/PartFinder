You are an expert electronics engineer. 
Based on the following project: “{text}”, generate ONLY a JSON object with this structure: 
{{ "components": [ {{ "name": "", "quantity": "<number>", "description": "" }} ] }} 
RULES: 
- "name" MUST be a simple, short, searchable part name (family-level). 
Examples: "STM32L4", "ESP32-WROOM", "LIS3DH", "AMS1117", "WS2812B". 
- BUT "description" MUST be detailed and helpful, including key specs, purpose in the project, and why it fits. 
- Provide only components available from mainstream suppliers. 
- Exclude mechanical parts, screws, 3D prints, tools, enclosures.
- "quantity" = 1 unless clearly more are required.
- Use the most appropriate components.
- Output ONLY the JSON. No explanations, no markdown.
